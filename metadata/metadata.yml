description: This specialized capsule is designed to append units information to a
  base NWB file, including spiking data and unit properties. In particular, it adds
  the Units table and several properties associated with the units, such as quality
  metrics, template metrics, as well as waveform mean and standard deviation. If the
  input session contains multiple experiments/recordings, one NWB file for each experiment-recording
  pair is produced.
